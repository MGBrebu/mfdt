## Overview
<p align="justify">
MFDT is a CLI/GUI tool that allows users to check a given directory or file system for malicious files. The tool calculates the hash for all provided files, compares the hashes against the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/national-software-reference-library-nsrl">NIST NSRL</a>, runs all remaining unknown files through <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a>, and generates a report for the user.

The tool includes an optional GUI for user convenience, though the tool is fully usable in the command line.
